# Employee Comments Template for Word Documents

## Instructions for Word Document Upload

When uploading a Word document (.docx) to the Thematic Analysis App, structure your comments as follows:

### Format 1: Line-by-Line Comments (Recommended)
```
Great work environment, but need better communication between departments
Management doesn't listen to our feedback and the workload is too heavy
Love the team culture and flexible working hours
Salary is competitive but career growth opportunities are limited
The office space is outdated and we need better equipment
```

### Format 2: Paragraph Comments
```
The company culture is generally positive, but there are communication gaps between different departments that need to be addressed.

Workload management has become a significant concern, with many employees feeling overwhelmed by unrealistic deadlines and expectations.

The flexible working arrangements have been a great improvement, allowing for better work-life balance.

Compensation packages are competitive in the market, but internal promotion opportunities seem limited.

Physical workspace improvements are needed, including better equipment and more modern facilities.
```

### Format 3: Numbered Comments
```
1. Great work environment, but need better communication between departments
2. Management doesn't listen to our feedback and the workload is too heavy
3. Love the team culture and flexible working hours
4. Salary is competitive but career growth opportunities are limited
5. The office space is outdated and we need better equipment
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Separate Comments**: Each comment should be on its own line or clearly separated
2. **Minimum Length**: Comments should be at least 10 characters long
3. **Clear Language**: Use clear, descriptive language for better theme identification
4. **No Formatting**: Avoid complex formatting, tables, or embedded objects
5. **Plain Text**: The app extracts plain text, so formatting will be lost

## What Gets Extracted

- ✅ Plain text content
- ✅ Line breaks and paragraph separations
- ✅ Basic punctuation

## What Doesn't Get Extracted

- ❌ Tables or structured data
- ❌ Images or embedded objects
- ❌ Complex formatting
- ❌ Demographic information (use CSV for this)

## For Demographic Data

If you need to include demographic information (department, gender, age, role), use a CSV file instead of a Word document. CSV files support structured data with columns for different attributes.
